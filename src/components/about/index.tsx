          soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole
          heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which
          was created for and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than
          now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me.

          I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and,
          as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by
          me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and
          grow familiar with the that I neglect my talents. I should be
          incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I
          feel that I never was a greater artist than. and yet I feel that I
          never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley
